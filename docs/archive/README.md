# Archive — Exploratory Design Notes

Documents in this folder are **exploratory design notes**, not part of the current project design or roadmap. They are kept for reference only and do not bind implementation decisions.

- **Agent consumability (v1 & v2):** Ideas on how QueryClaw could be used by other agents (MCP, programmatic API, unbundled architecture). These are discussion documents, not current design.
