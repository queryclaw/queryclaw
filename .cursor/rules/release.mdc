# Release Process

**All version releases MUST update RELEASE_NOTES (both EN and CN) before pushing to GitHub and publishing to PyPI.**

When bumping version or publishing:

1. Update `RELEASE_NOTES.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES_CN.md` with the new version's changes
2. Move "Unreleased" items to the version section; add release date
3. See [docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md) for the full checklist
